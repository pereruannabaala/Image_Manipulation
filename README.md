# Image Manipulation with OpenCV

## Overview
This project demonstrates various image processing techniques using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib in Python. It includes downloading assets, reading and modifying images, cropping, resizing, and flipping images.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Features
1 Downloading Assets

The script downloads a ZIP file containing image assets and extracts them to the current working directory.

2 Reading an Image

The script reads an image in grayscale mode and displays it using Matplotlib.

3 Modifying Image Pixels

Specific pixels in an image are modified and displayed.

4 Cropping an Image

Extracts a specific region from an image.

5 Resizing an Image

The image is resized using different methods:

- Scaling factors

- Specifying exact dimensions

- Maintaining aspect ratio

6. Flipping an Image

The script flips an image horizontally, vertically, and in both directions.
